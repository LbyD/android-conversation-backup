Conversation Backup v1.1
========================

This tool can backup your SMS messages, MMS messages, and call logs, for a set of numbers specified, or all numbers, into a zip file, which can be emailed to you for archiving. The tool can also delete archived messages and/or call logs from your device if requested.

This supports Android 2.1 and above. 

This zip file created by the tool contains:
- summary.json (json file summarizing your request)
- messages.json (json file containing all backed up SMS and MMS)
- call_log.json (json file containing call logs)
- other files (mms.<id>.<filename>) which are all MMS attachments referenced from messages
- index.html (allows you view your backed up information easily on a browser, working off the JSON files above)

NOTE: 
=====
Please consider this BETA software. Use the delete functionality at your own risk, since that alters your SMS and/or call records when requested. All the other options only read information and are risk free.
